# SharedStorage
SharedStorage offers a new way to communicate between workers and there parent window, by offering a new storage object that works much in the same way as LocalStorage and SessionStorage. However SharedStorage doesn't store it's data to retrieve it at a later moment, but instead to retrieve it from a different scope.
